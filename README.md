# Johnny five controlling a snake arm

> This repository is now archived.

Final year project controlling a snake arm.

The snake arm uses stepper motors (afaik)

The current requirements are:

- Building a web interface to control the steppers.
- Allow easy configuration of the limiting variables.
- View the other configurations in a read-only fashion.
- Have an HTML form-based input which allows the control.
